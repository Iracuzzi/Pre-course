# News Site 

I made a magazine to talk about videogames, simulating news informations and "fake news".

## The problem

That was not easy because I had to learn flexbox and CSS Grids, so I struggle with that because I never used it before. Furthermore, I had to search for a lot of information, and learn how to change and edit the style. It's been very instructing to me.
Another issue that I faced is that I started with CodePen, but when I found the way on how to do it I realized it was easier with VSCode.
If I would've had more time, I would probably implemented more details within the page.
