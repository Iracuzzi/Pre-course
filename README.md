# News Site 

I made a magazine to talk about videogames, simulating news informations and "fake news".

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

That was not easy, becouse I lerned how to create a flexbox and css grids, I had very trubles with that becouse i never used it before,  i had to search a lot of information, and learn how to change and edit the stylish.
I started with CodePen but when I reserch how do the things I see was more easy to do with VSCode.
If i had more time I would like to incorporate more interaccions with the page.
